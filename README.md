# SvelteKit Authentication with Lucia V3: An Example Project

This example project showcases how to integrate Lucia V3 for user authentication in a SvelteKit application. User data is stored in a local SQLite database. The project is split into branches, each demonstrating a different aspect of the authentication process. Each branch builds on top of the previous one, with the last branch being the most comprehensive and up-to-date.

## Project Branches

- [Main Branch](https://github.com/edwardspresume/sveltekit-lucia-auth-v3-example/tree/main)
- [Email Verification Branch](https://github.com/edwardspresume/sveltekit-lucia-auth-v3-example/tree/email_verification)
- [Password Reset Branch](https://github.com/edwardspresume/sveltekit-lucia-auth-v3-example/tree/password_reset)
- [Oauth & account linking Branch](https://github.com/edwardspresume/sveltekit-lucia-auth-v3-example/tree/oauth)
